## 🚨 COMMON REJECTION REASONS & HOW TO AVOID

### 1. Insufficient Content
**❌ Problem**: Website looks incomplete or has placeholder content  
**✅ Solution**: We've avoided this - all pages have real content

**❌ Problem**: Affiliate manager can't understand how you'll promote products  
**✅ Solution**: Our "How It Works" page clearly explains our model

### 3. Missing Disclosure
**❌ Problem**: No visible affiliate disclosure on site  
**✅ Solution**: We have disclosure in 3 locations (AI, modal, dedicated page)

### 4. Low Traffic Potential
